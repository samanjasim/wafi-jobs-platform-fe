# AlWafi Logo Setup

## Instructions for adding the logo:

1. Save the `alwafi-logo.jpeg` file to: `public/images/alwafi-logo.jpeg`
2. The logo is now configured to display in both the header and footer of the job application form
3. The logo will be displayed at the proper size with responsive scaling

## Logo specifications in the app:
- Header: 80px height on mobile, 96px on desktop
- Footer: 48px height
- Format: JPEG (as requested)
- Location: `/public/images/alwafi-logo.jpeg`

## Fallback behavior:
If the logo file is not found, a text fallback "Delta AlWafi" will be displayed instead.
